\section{Purpose of Venn Create}
The system under development is a desktop app that can draw customizable
Venn diagrams.

A Venn diagram (also called primary diagram, set diagram or logic diagram) is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite
collection of different sets. It is a great way to present relationships
between sets of objects, such as set intersection or set difference.

By using Venn Create, user can easily create Venn diagrams with customized
labels, in different size and shape. Which can be used to compare and
contrast two or more objects, events, people, or concepts. Clearly
illustrating the differences and similarities between different entities.

Venn Create provides a user-friendly interface, so that new users will
be able to use the application with minimum efforts. In addition,
the application provides essential functionalities, such as export/import
existing Venn diagrams, printing and customized theming.

\section{Document Conventions and Dictionary}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Venn diagram}: a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. 
	\item \textbf{acceptance test}: a test conducted to demonstrate to the user (or customer), prior to delivery, that their requirements for the product are met. In this document it is a sequence of actions that the user may perform at the User Interface (e.g. \texttt{at1.txt}) and the expected response  of the system to those actions (e.g. \textit{at1.expected.txt}). Acceptance tests help to validate that the system is ``fit for use".
\end{itemize}
